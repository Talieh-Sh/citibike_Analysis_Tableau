# Citi Bike Project - Comprehensive Bike Ride Analysis (Oct-Dec 2023)

## Project Overview

This project provides a thorough analysis of Citi Bike ride data during the autumn to early winter months of 2023. The study leverages the advanced visualization capabilities of Tableau to reveal insightful trends and usage patterns within New York's extensive bike-sharing system.

### About Citi Bike
More information about the Citi Bike program can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike).

## Data Acquisition and Preparation

We sourced our data from [TripData](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html), covering the months of October, November, and December 2023.

### Data Processing Steps
- **Cleaning and Manipulation:** Implemented with Python for optimal data integrity.
- **Merging:** Integrated three distinct CSV files into a comprehensive dataset.
- **Final Dataset:** Consists of approximately 230,000 records.

## Data Features

The dataset includes vital attributes such as:
- Ride ID
- Type of Rideable
- Start and End Times
- Station Identifiers and Names
- Geographic Coordinates for each station
- User Classification (Member or Casual)
- Month Information for each ride

## Data Utilization

- **Visualization Tool:** Tableau.
- **Objective:** To identify and understand the bike ride trends and user behaviors.

## Insights and Analyses

- **Ride Metrics:** A downward trend in ride count, distance, and duration was observed from October to December, possibly indicating seasonal influence on ridership.
- **Usage Patterns:** Peak usage hours were consistently found during morning and evening commute times, and weekdays showed higher usage compared to weekends.
- **Station Popularity:** Key stations such as Hoboken Terminal and Grove St PATH had the highest footfall, suggesting they are critical hubs for commuters.
- **Geographical Trends:** Spatial analysis highlighted the concentration of rides starting in midtown areas and dispersing towards residential neighborhoods.
- **Member vs. Casual Analysis:** Members generally took shorter, more frequent rides, while casual riders had longer trip durations, potentially indicating different usage motivations.
